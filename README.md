# Dildora Alimdjanova: TechCells Task 

### Although I don't have experience in React yet, I used this chance to build a simple page layout using HTML and CSS. I would very much appreciate your feedback.

### Please take a look at the completed tasks:

- [Enter Your PIN to Clock In](https://didathehacker.github.io/api/clockin.html)
- [Enter Your PIN to Clock Out](https://didathehacker.github.io/api/clockout.html)
- [You have clocked out successfully](https://didathehacker.github.io/api/clockout-done.html)
- [You have clocked in successfully](https://didathehacker.github.io/api/clockin-done.html)

- [Admin Logged In Page](https://didathehacker.github.io/api/admin-login.html)

 Having much to learn, I am looking for an opportunity that will let me build a solid professional foundation. I believe that TechCells would be a great place to kickstart my career as a frontend developer intern.
